This is a verilog code for implementing Seven Segment Display on the Real Digital Blackboard. 
The Real Digital Blackboard is an ARM and FPGA development board based on the ZYNQ 7000 device from Xilinx.
The board contains 4 digits for the Seven Segment Display. 
The 16 switches on the board have been divided in sets of 4 each, to make 4-bit numbers. 
The first 4 switches (0-3) represent the first digit on the seven segment display. 
Next 4 switches (4-7) represent the second digit on the seven segment display.
Next 4 switches (8-11) represent the third digit on the seven segment display.
Next 4 switches (12-15) represent the last digit on the seven segment display.
Depending on the combination of these switches, numbers/values (0-F) are seen on the seven segment display.
